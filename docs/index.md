## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard that enables AI assistants to securely interact with local and remote resources. This MCP server implements 8 specialized tools for MkDocs documentation management.

## Why Use This?

Instead of manually editing documentation files, your AI assistant can:

- Create new documentation pages with proper structure
- Update existing content while preserving frontmatter
- Search across all docs to find relevant sections
- Reorganize navigation structure
- Delete outdated documentation

All through natural conversation!
